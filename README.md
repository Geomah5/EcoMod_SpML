# Machine learning strategies for spatial prediction models (in remote sensing applications) 
This repository contains the R-scripts for the analysis described in the paper "Importance of spatial predictor variable selection in machine learning applications - Moving from data reproduction to spatial prediction" published in Ecological Modelling (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108815).

You can test the described modelling strategies using the tutorial prepared for the OpenGeoHub Summer school in MÃ¼nster 2019: https://github.com/HannaMeyer/OpenGeoHub_2019
